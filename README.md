# RR_RSS_networks
This repository contains code snippets and a small demo to illustrate the networks used in the paper "Detecting coordinated and bot-like behavior in Twitter: the JÃ¼rgen Conings case"

Notes:
- If you want to make use of the OpenAI embedding models, you should have a folders `secrets` which holds your API key
- The Twitter data is assumed to be stored in a MongoDB with a collection holding the raw tweets and another one with the authors that accur in the dataset.
